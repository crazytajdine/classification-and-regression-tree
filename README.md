# classification-and-regression-tree
This is a simple regression/classification tree approach that I have been contemplating for a while. In this method,I used the mean of a group of points that are close to each others and if a value x has multiple values {y1 ,..yp} ,I take the mean of them as one point . a weighted mean is utilized, assigning the highest weight to the element with the least error. This ensures that elements with lower correlation will have a smaller weight. 
<div>There's 2 datasets :</div>
<div>regression : Housing.csv  </div>
<div> classification : companion_plants.csv </div>
<br>
<div>Note: This is my approach, so the results may not be optimal, but it is functioning. I will continue learning and updating the model.</div>
